# 🧰 pipx-scripts

A collection of custom Python command-line tools designed to be installed and run using [`pipx`](https://github.com/pypa/pipx). Each script lives in its own isolated environment and serves a focused purpose — from system cleanup to Steam fixes to video downloading.

## 📦 Included Tools

| Tool                        | Description                                                                                                                           |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| **`ytgrabber`**             | Downloads videos using `yt-dlp`. Automatically updates to the latest version.                                                         |
| **`fixsteamcompatibility`** | Moves all Proton compatibility prefixes to a native filesystem and replaces them with symlinks — solving Steam/Proton symlink issues. |
| **`kernelcleaner`**         | Safely removes old Linux kernel versions to free up disk space.                                                                       |
| **`brightshift`**           | Instantly adjusts monitor brightness using `xrandr`, useful for multi-monitor Linux setups.                                           |
| **`shrinkaudio`**           | Batch-downsizes MP3 and M4A files by slightly lowering their bitrate using `ffmpeg`. Skips files prefixed with `OLD`.                 |

Each tool is completely self-contained and can be installed or uninstalled independently.
